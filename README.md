# 1st-year-project-face-recognition
1 - This project implements a face recognition system using Python, the 'face_recognition' library, and OpenCV. The system is capable of detecting and identifying faces in real-time video streams, making it suitable for various applications such as security, surveillance, and personalized user experiences.
2 - Place your known face images in the faces directory. Each image should contain a single face of the person you want to recognize, and the filename should correspond to the person's name or identifier.
3 - make sure to install cmake "pip install cmake dlib==19.22"
